 * GPU configuration. You should play around with threads and blocks as the fastest settings will vary.
 * index         - GPU index number usually starts from 0.
 * threads       - Number of GPU threads (nothing to do with CPU threads).
 * blocks        - Number of GPU blocks (nothing to do with CPU threads).
 * bfactor       - Enables running the Cryptonight kernel in smaller pieces.
 *                 Increase if you want to reduce GPU lag. Recommended setting on GUI systems - 8
 * bsleep        - Insert a delay of X microseconds between kernel launches.
 *                 Increase if you want to reduce GPU lag. Recommended setting on GUI systems - 100
 * affine_to_cpu - This will affine the thread to a CPU. This can make a GPU miner play along nicer with a CPU miner.
 *
 * On the first run the miner will look at your system and suggest a basic configuration that will work,
 * you can try to tweak it from there to get the best performance.
 *

 * Network timeouts.

 * nearly all cases. If they aren't the pool has most likely overload issues. Low call timeout values are preferable -
 * long timeouts mean that we waste hashes on potentially stale jobs. Connection report will tell you how long the
 * server usually takes to process our calls.

 * call_timeout - How long should we wait for a response from the server before we assume it is dead and drop the connection.
 * retry_time	- How long should we wait before another connection attempt.

 * giveup_limit - Limit how many times we try to reconnect to the pool. Zero means no limit. Note that stak miners
